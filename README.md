<h1>MANNIE Help</h1>
                <p>Thank you for playing the next best part of BOXES--Mannie!</p>
                <p>Mannie is only a 1 player game. You are the happy face located somewhere around the upper left hand corner. The object is to try to get a high score by collecting the spades, clubs, diamonds, and hearts. The only trouble is that some walls block your way to some of them. That is why you have special attacks--moves that allow to break through these walls. To move Mannie, the happy face, use the arrow keys. Pause the game by pushing 'P'. To toggle on or off sound effects, push 'O'. You have three and a half minutes to collect the items! When you collect all the items or time runs out, you will receive 100 pts. for each remaining second. You will receive points for the each remaining item you have. Their point value is as follows.</p>
                <p><strong>Spades:</strong> 500 pts. Spades needed to use attack: 4; 5000 pts.<br>
                Attack Description: Destroys surrounding walls. (Total Destruction: 8)<br>
                Type 'S' to use the Spade Attack.</p>
                <p><strong>Clubs:</strong> 1000 pts. Clubs needed to use attack: 5; 15000 pts.<br>
                Attack Description: Destroys surrounding walls and walls surrounding those. (Total Destruction: 15)<br>
                Type 'C' to use the Club Attack.</p>
                <p><strong>Diamonds:</strong> 2000 pts. Diamonds needed to use attack: 7; 50000 pts.<br>
                Attack Description: You chose row or column to destroy that surrounds you. Spade Attack used too. (Minimum Destruction: 8)<br>
                Type 'D' to use the Diamond Attack.</p>
                <p><strong>Hearts:</strong> 5000 pts. Hearts needed to use attack: 10; 100000 pts<br>
                Attack Description: The first time using it all Spades become Clubs. The second time causes Clubs to become Diamonds. The third time makes all Diamonds become Hearts. The fourth time causes all the walls to disappear. Anytime after that adds 10 seconds to your time.<br>
                Type 'H' to use the Heart Attack.</p>
                <p>If you want to ever exit Mannie, simply push 'X'. You don't get any lives in this game, and there is only one level. Try to beat BST if you can.</p>
